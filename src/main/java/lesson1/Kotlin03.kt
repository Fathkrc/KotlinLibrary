    //area(heigth=23,witdh=35) if we change parameter line it still understands from our paremeters
    //we don't have to write parameter names it still gets it
    //don't need to type ";" at the end
    // We don't have to write with all project with kotlin we can add a class based on kotlin
    // and use is as a class in a Java Project
    //It can run anywhere where java can run (Instructors words)
    //It's working as Object Oriented but it also can work as functional progamming   //verbose(ayrıntılı)
    /* Kotlin Principles
    1-) Conciseness (özlülük, kısalık basitlik)
    2-) Safety (about exceptions)
    3-) Pragmatism more like solving problems not staying on research
    4-) Interoperability(birlikte çalışılabilirlik)
