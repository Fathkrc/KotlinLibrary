class Inheritance01 {
    // every unit is declared as public and final in Kotlin
    // so if we want to extend any class we use "OPEN" keyword on parent class
    // we also have to call constructor in subclass with super()
    //we can also make our parent class abstract
    // we can also override methods but they are also being declared as final so we can add open
    //  we can create methods if we want to override abstract methods we havr to add override if method is not abstract
    // if we make an overriden method final it can not be overriden from sub classes
    // primary constructor is always choosen first
